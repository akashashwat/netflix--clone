# netflix--clone
This project is a Netflix clone, created as part of my internship to demonstrate my skills in web development and front-end technologies. Since this is just a front-end representation and doesn't include streaming functionality, it was an amazing learning experience, and I'm proud of the results.


## Features

- **Netflix UI Replica:** This project replicates the user interface of the popular streaming platform Netflix, allowing users to browse movies and TV shows.
